## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My goal was to create an application that took in user input using the node.js framework on the user computer and to dynamically generate the inputs into html files, updating all within the node.js framework itself. 
- This 'app' was build using javascript, the ES6 module, some css to style the page, and node.js.
- It helps a user to generate a portfolio of projects based on the user's answers and their GitHub repos without writing a seperate html file, eliminating the need for such tedious work.
- I learned a lot about node.js and how I can use promises to circumvent the need for 'callback hell'. It was a really enjoyable experience.

## Installation

This project requires node.js to run, so please install the latest version by going to their website and downloading it. Moreover, you must download/clone the repo in order to use it. It does not exist on a server somewhere in California... 

## Usage

Here is how to use the 'app'.
1. You must launch the node file using your command line. It could be launched in the Git bash shell too. So in the terminal, write node app.js to get started.
2. You will be asked questions that relate to how the final page will look. First, you will be asked your name, github name, and whether or not you want to include any information about yourself. If you choose 'no', you will not see anything in this section after you generate the html file. More on that later.
3. When you finish the 'about' section, you will be asked about your **projects**. This is the 'crux' of this app, which will let you showcase your projects! So be descriptive! And another important thing: when asked if you'd like to feature this project, it will affect the final look of that section in the projects part. If you do not feature it, it will be stylized differently. If you feature it, the content will span the entire page and will be 'more visible' on the page. 
4. After answering all the questions, you will be able to see the result by going into the 'dist' folder and launching the created html file. And voila... enjoy the generator!!
